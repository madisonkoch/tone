### Problem:
    It's no great secret that this world has some not-so-nice individuals in it and even though the, as
    the saying goes, "sticks and stone can break my bones but words could never hurt me," we all know
    that's not true. Bullying can happen anywhere, at any age, and in any form on multiple platforms.
    Verbal, using had gestures, private messages, public messages, social posts, you name it... And
    that's a problem. 
    
    Although we can't tackle the entirety of the problem that is bullying, we could all check ourselved
    before sending out something a little more hurtfull or toxic than intended. But, lets be even more
    honest with ourselves, we're the worst jusdges of ourselves - no objectivity.

### Description:
    This app is intended to give individuals unbiased feedback on how toxic the message they're about to
    send could be & show how toxic messages from others are to increase their awareness of how not just 
    their words, but the tone behind them can be toxic.
